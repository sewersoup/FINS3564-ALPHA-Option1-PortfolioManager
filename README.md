# FINS3645-ALPHA-Option1-PortfolioManager

ALPHA aims to design an automated, data-driven portfolio management system for an asset management firm,
utilizing a wide range of inputs including market and sentiment indicators, news, and other diverse data streams.
This involves setting up a data ingestion pipeline to structure incoming data, conducting exploratory data analysis
and feature extraction, developing predictive machine learning models for market trends and asset returns,
and optimizing portfolio allocation based on these predictions. The performance of the models and the resulting
portfolio allocations will be back-tested using historical data for further fine-tuning and improvement.
